# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Password-generator

You can check out the [password-generator app](https://password-generator-henna-six.vercel.app/) for generating secure passwords. This tool allows you to customize your password by specifying the length, including numbers, and choosing whether to include alphabets. Once you've configured your preferences, you can easily copy the generated password.
